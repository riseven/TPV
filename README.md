*POS software for cafe.*

This a POS software for a cafe. I developed after my first year at the university, and
there are some things that I would like to change in it (mainly, the fact that it needs
a proper database).

It is done in C# and winforms, and I'm happy that it has been in production for near ten
years with not a single problem. Its interface has also been praised by industry experts
as the best in the sector.
